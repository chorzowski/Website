							<p>Bound by the heritage of the region, its historical dynamics, 
							its numerous cultures and the leading role of industry, and yet recognizing 
							Silesia’s intellectual and artistic background, Muzeum Śląskie provides a space for 
							dialogue with the past and the achievements of modernity to further explore Silesia, 
							Poland and Europe. The underground space also includes educational rooms, a library 
							with a reading room, an auditorium with 320 seats, an educational corner for children 
							and space for temporary exhibitions that is 12.5 m high. After exploring the riches 
							of the depths of Muzeum Śląskie, you might want to have a look at Katowice from quite 
							a different angle offered by our observation tower. The observation platform is located 
							40 metres above the ground. The former Warszawa II shaft offers views of the entire 
							Culture Zone and the city skyline. After a day of observing art, you might also want 
							to head for one of the three museum restaurants.
